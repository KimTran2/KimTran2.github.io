<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating.

Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes.
