The IC decline was almost entirely centered on Class 4, indoor cushion tire equipment, which fell 11% as Class 5 remained flat. Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Often, a driver will raise the axle to enable the vehicle to turn easier and not have to drag the lift axle sideways through a turn.

If you know you need a forklift, but aren't sure if you'll encounter another equipment need with the same project, look no further.

Class VII: Rough terrain forklift trucks - Exclusively for outdoor use, these trucks handle rough terrains such as unimproved construction sites. Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>
