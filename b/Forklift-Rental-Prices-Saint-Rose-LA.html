It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>
