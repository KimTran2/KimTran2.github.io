<h3>Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks Tupelo MS 38801</h3>
<p>Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack. Most businesses are cyclical in nature, so renting extra trucks will help a business through the surges of seasonal business. A reach is designed with two unique operator platforms. A person must learn how to drive a forklift while carrying a payload.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
