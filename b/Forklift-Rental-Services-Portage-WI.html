<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>

Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance.

<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
