<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments. Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work. Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks.</p>
