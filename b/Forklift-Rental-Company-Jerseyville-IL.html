<h2>Working With A Forklift Or Pallet Jacks Jerseyville </h2>
<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving.

Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.

Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>
