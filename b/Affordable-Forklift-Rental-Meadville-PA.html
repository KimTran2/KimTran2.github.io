<p>According to a report from the Industrial Truck Association (ITA), more than a quarter million units were sold, representing a 2.8% increase from 2017. With the installation of a suspension lift, however, you can get a lot greater clearance. Mono Tube shocks with reservoir cylinder are constructed with off-road attitude and performance in mind.

Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015.
