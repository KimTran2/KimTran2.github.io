Using a pressure washer comes in handy when washing lifted trucks, from applying soap using a foam cannon, to cleaning the inside of your wheel wells.</p>

Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
