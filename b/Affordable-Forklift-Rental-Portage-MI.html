Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>

Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
