The extremely versatile Toyota Walkie Reach Truck assists in decreasing operator fatigue and downtime by making maneuvering products through the warehouse quick and efficient.

Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
