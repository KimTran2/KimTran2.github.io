In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Therefore owing to the communication advancements, the growth for the connected Forklift Trucks will gain traction over the forecast period. Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again.
