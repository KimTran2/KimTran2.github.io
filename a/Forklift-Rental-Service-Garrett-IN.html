Other drivers of the market include new product development, mergers & acquisitions, and partnerships among players in the pallet truck market. The benefits of owning a lifted truck are numerous.

A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people.
