As you drive into a left-hand corner, the right tire will increase in weight as the vehicles weight is transferred from the centerline.</p>

We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>

Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks. Crown also introduced a number of technology enhancements to improve forklift safety. At ProMat 2019 in booth #S3603, attendees can view the brand-new YaleÂ® robotic reach truck, an industry-first dual-mode pantograph robotic lift truck capable of autonomously depositing and retrieving loads from locations as high as 30 feet and reaching into double-deep storage.</p>

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
