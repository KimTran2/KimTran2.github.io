The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you.

<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus. With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>With the test load elevated to maximum height, and for trucks with tilting up 4 rights without change in the original overhang dimensions, the test platform shall be tipped to the specified slope.

<p>Counterbalance forklifts are most commonly used indoors in settings such as warehouses and retail spaces. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height. Once you've found the right type of rough terrain forklift for your job site, the biggest decision you'll have to make is between renting and buying.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>This type of forklift makes use of pneumatic or air-filled tires, as opposed to counterbalance forklifts which use cushion tires. Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces. The lift truck industry experienced a host of new equipment innovations over the past year.
