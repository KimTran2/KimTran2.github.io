<p>Product-line features: Omega covers all bases with its vertical-mast forklift offering. The nine-model P-Series RT forklift range includes units with rated lift capacities from 5,000 to 30,000 pounds (24-inch load center), with two-, three-, and four-section mast configurations. Single-double forks - forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.</p>
<p>Our ranges of products like Standard Hand Hydraulic Pallet Truck are designed and developed using advanced technology and superior quality raw material. In the electric forklift, the battery acts partially as a counterweight which saves space. Designed to automatically lock the pallet for a secure grip, the Automatic Pallet Grip feature provides optimum control of the load.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights.

<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Make stock picking easier and effortless by introducing an electric powered ride on picker to you warehouse workflow.

<p>If you need a forklift ASAP, renting may be for the way to go, as you can eliminate the hassle of third-party financing or credit requirements. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.
