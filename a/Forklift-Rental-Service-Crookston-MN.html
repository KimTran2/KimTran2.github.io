<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>
