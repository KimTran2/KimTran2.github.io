A forklift (also called a lift truck or a forklift truck) is a vehicle designated to move materials in places such as warehouses, factories, farms and many more.</p>

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>Built to tackle any type of environment, the K2 package includes 6-inch suspension lift-kit, custom wheels and tires. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck.
