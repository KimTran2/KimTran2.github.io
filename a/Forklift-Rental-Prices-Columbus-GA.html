Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Before choosing a standup forklift, it's important to determine the size of the typical load that you will be lifting. Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials. Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision.

Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts.
