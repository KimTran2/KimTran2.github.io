<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Counterbalance forklift trucks are versatile and can be operated both indoors and outdoors. H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>Where as a Telescoping Boom Lift is best suited to outdoor construction applications where reach is required to place loads on top of structures under construction. Also considered as one of the very good pallet trucks, this is a very powerful pallet jack. In this research scope, Class I, Class II, Class III, Class IV and Class V types of forklift trucks are analyzed and revenue is estimated.</p>

<p>But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts. The North American electric truck market grew 6%, whereas the IC market was down 5%. The IC decline was almost entirely centered on Class 4, indoor cushion tire equipment, which fell 11% as Class 5 remained flat. Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>

<p>Depending on your needs, you may find that a pallet jack is the best fit for your warehouse or product. These trucks like most of our products come up with the option of customization. Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks.

<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world.

Class 2: Electric Motor Narrow Aisle Trucks. Most lifted Chevrolet owners don't pay attention to the other portions of their vehicles once they increase its clearance height.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks have a cab that tilts so that the operator can have a better view of the fork carriage, while others actually have small cameras attached to the carriage. Class VII: Rough terrain forklift trucks - Exclusively for outdoor use, these trucks handle rough terrains such as unimproved construction sites. Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. To ensure that your pickup truck is secure to ride while off-roading after this type of modification, you need to invest in larger tires.</p>
