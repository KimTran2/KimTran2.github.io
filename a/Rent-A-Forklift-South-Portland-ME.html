<h2>Material Handling Trucks South Portland</h2>
<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift.

<h3>Heavy Duty Forklift South Portland ME</h3>
<p>When it's time to choose a supplier for your forklift needs, it's important to know that they take your questions and concerns seriously. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
<p>Our exclusive ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers industry-leading lift, lower and travel speeds and easy-to-use ergonomic controls enhance operator comfort for greater productivity. A lifted vehicle becomes naturally top heavy, which causes it to be sensitive while cornering and braking. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
