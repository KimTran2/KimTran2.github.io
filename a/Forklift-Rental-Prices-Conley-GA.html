<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Second, you need to make sure you request a rental unit which has the specifications best suited to the loads you are trying to move. If you're searching for forklift companies in Victoria and Melbourne that offer exceptional quality customer service as well as unparalleled machinery, Damoli is for you.
