<p>Electric forklift not holding charge? Best of all, these GMC lifted truck modifications do not voice the warranty. Most rough terrain forklift accidents are caused by operator error. With our years of industry experience, we are able to successfully cater to the variegated demands of our clients by offering them Standard Pallet Truck.

<p>We are largest supplier adn importer of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck. It creates physical equilibrium at the forklift height and an equivalent force from the Gas and the Forklift's Load.
