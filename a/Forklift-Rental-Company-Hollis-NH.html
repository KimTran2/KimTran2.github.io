As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be. With a suspension lift, the wheels are pushed down from the frame and come in different varieties such as coil-spring bushings, leaf spring shackles of full-blown suspension kits.</p>

Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
<h2>Pallet Stacker Hollis</h2>
<p>The fork lift truck used for the training at Coleg Menai is GAS OPERATED. Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock. First, take the time to train your whole crew to use rough terrain forklifts.

<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money. Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Whether it's for a short-term job, a seasonal spike in business, or you're a small operation with limited resources; renting can be a perfect solution for you. Help lift and move pallets more easily with rugged pallet jacks from Grainger in the size, style and color of your choice. Forklifts have a stability triangle.
