<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck.</p>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
