<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>
<h2>Lifted Truck Dealers Tempe</h2>
<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>

<p>It will allow you to efficiently pick goods on a pallet and quickly move from rack to rack as well as give you the ability to drive the lifter into a container in order to unload goods. Forklifts come in many sizes, shapes, colors and functions. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift. Its stabilized legs and forward extending forks enables this warehouse truck to extend upwards to reach racks that are usually too high for a standard forklift.</p>
<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops. If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be. However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
