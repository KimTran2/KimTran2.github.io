A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv.

From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts.</p>
