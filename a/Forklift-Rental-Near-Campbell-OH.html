Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>The company says its new products offer advances in efficiency technology with Toyota's optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking. As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be. With a suspension lift, the wheels are pushed down from the frame and come in different varieties such as coil-spring bushings, leaf spring shackles of full-blown suspension kits.</p>
