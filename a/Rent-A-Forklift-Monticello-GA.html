A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick. Its optimized design and 68.5” truck length - the shortest in the industry - ensures it can maneuver where no other 3-wheel counterbalance forklift can.</p>

These features ensure that the machines can move safely on loose ground, rocky areas, and uneven terrain.</p>

Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements. The standard course is intended to last for 5 days but for an experienced Forklift Truck Operator who holds a valid or recently expired certificate, a 3 day refresher can be attended.</p>
