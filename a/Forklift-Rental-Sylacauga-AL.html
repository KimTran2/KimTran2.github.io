We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks. As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
