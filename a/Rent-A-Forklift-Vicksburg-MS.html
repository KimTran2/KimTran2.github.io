While many people may choose a long-handled brush for washing lifted trucks, I would opt for using foam to remove dirt instead of a brush. H Series forklifts use a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst to meet Tier 4 Final emissions standards.</p>
<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>

Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling.

Regardless of whether you are looking for routine lifted truck maintenance or extensive collision repair, we've got you covered at Laura Buick GMC. There has been talk of making DOT crash bars mandatory on all lifted vehicles, to help eliminate stock-height vehicles from continuing underneath a lifted vehicle.</p>
