<h2>Used Forklifts Or New Forklifts Get Rid Of Your Dilemma Portland </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Driving a couple of inches higher will not only offer you a much better view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris.

<p>If you are an adventurous individual or you just need a truck with significant size and power, then you definitely have to test drive one of our lifted trucks. The company builds 350,000 trucks each year, and their lowest lift weight is only 1,500 lbs while their heavy duty units can lift 100,000 lbs. Whether you're searching for your first lift truck, replacing a piece of equipment or expanding your fleet, we hope this breakdown of the various forklift classifications is helpful as you focus on finding the ideal type of forklift or materials handling equipment for your company.</p>
