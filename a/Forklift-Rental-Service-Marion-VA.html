<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

Electric forklifts are cheaper to operate as they cost less for fuel, require lower maintenance (having fewer moving parts), need less replacement of fluids and have considerably fewer lost hours from maintenance downtime and breakdown.</p>
